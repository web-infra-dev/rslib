# lib.redirect

- **Type:**

```ts
type Redirect = {
  style?: boolean;
};
```

- **Default:**

```ts
const defaultRedirect = {
  style: true,
};
```

Configure the redirect of the import paths.

When `bundle: false`, the import path is redirected to ensure that it points to the correct output.

:::note

As bundleless mode is still under development, additional redirect configurations will be introduced in the future.

:::

If you don't need these redirects, you can turn it off, and its import path will not be changed.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  lib: [
    {
      redirect: {
        style: false, // Turn off the redirect of the style file
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## redirect.style

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Whether to redirect the import path of the style file. For example:

- `import './index.less'` will be rewritten to `import './index.css'`
