# Module Federation

This chapter will introduce how to quickly build Module Federation products in Rslib

## Glossary

Module Federation is a JavaScript application divide-and-conquer architecture pattern (similar to server-side microservices) that allows you to share code and resources between multiple JavaScript applications (or Micro-Frontend).

## Usage scenarios

Module federation has some typical usage scenarios, including:

Allows independent applications (called "Micro-Frontend" in the Micro-Frontend architecture) to share modules without having to recompile the entire application.
Different teams work on different parts of the same application without having to recompile the entire application.
Dynamic code loading and sharing between applications at runtime.
Module federation can help you:

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve code maintainability
- Reduce the overall size of the application
- Improve application performance

## Quick access

First install the Module Federation Rsbuild Plugin (Rslib is built on Rsbuild)

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm add @module-federation/rsbuild-plugin --save-dev',
    yarn: 'yarn add @module-federation/rsbuild-plugin --save-dev',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @module-federation/rsbuild-plugin --save-dev',
    bun: 'bun add @module-federation/rsbuild-plugin --save-dev',
  }}
/>

Add the plugin to the `rslib.config.ts` file

```ts title='rslib.config.ts'
import { pluginModuleFederation } from '@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin';
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';
import { defineConfig } from '@rslib/core';

export default defineConfig({
  lib: [
    // ... other format
    {
      format: 'mf',
      output: {
        distPath: {
          root: './dist/mf',
        },
        // add your assetPrefix here
        assetPrefix: 'http://localhost:3001/mf',
      },
      plugins: [
        pluginModuleFederation({
          name: 'rslib_provider',
          exposes: {
            // add expose here
          },
          // can not add 'remote' here, because you may build 'esm' or 'cjs' assets in one build.
          // if you want the rslib package use remote module, please see below.
          shared: {
            react: {
              singleton: true,
            },
            'react-dom': {
              singleton: true,
            },
          },
        }),
      ],
    },
  ],
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
});
```

In this way, we have completed the integration of Rslib Module as a producer. After the construction is completed, we can see that the mf directory has been added to the product, and consumers can directly consume this package

In the above example we added a new `format: 'mf'` , which will help you add an additional Module Federation product, while also configuring the format of `cjs` and `esm` , which does not conflict.

However, if you want this Rslib Module to consume other producers at the same time, do not use the build configuration `remote` parameter, because in other formats, this may cause errors, please refer to the example below using the Module Federation runtime

## Consume other Module Federation modules

Because there are multiple formats in Rslib, if you configure the `remote` parameter to consume other modules during construction, it may not work properly in all formats. It is recommended to access through the [Module Federation Runtime](https://module-federation.io/guide/basic/runtime.html)

First install the runtime dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm add @module-federation/enhanced --save',
    yarn: 'yarn add @module-federation/enhanced --save',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @module-federation/enhanced --save',
    bun: 'bun add @module-federation/enhanced --save',
  }}
/>

Then consume other Module Federation modules at runtime, for example

```ts
import { init, loadRemote } from '@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin/runtime';
import { Suspense, createElement, lazy } from 'react';

init({
  name: 'rslib_provider',
  remotes: [
    {
      name: 'mf_remote',
      entry: 'http://localhost:3002/mf-manifest.json',
    },
  ],
});

export const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>loading</div>}>
        {createElement(
          lazy(
            () =>
              loadRemote('mf_remote') as Promise<{
                default: React.FC;
              }>,
          ),
        )}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This ensures that modules can be loaded as expected in multiple formats

## FAQs

If the Rslib producer is built with build, this means that the `process.env.NODE_ENV` of the producer is `production` . If the consumer is started in dev mode at this time,
Due to the shared loading policy of Module Federation being `version-first` by default, there may be problems loading into different modes of react and react-dom (e.g. react in development mode, react-dom in production mode).
You can set up [shareStrategy](https://module-federation.io/configure/sharestrategy) at the consumer to solve this problem, but make sure you fully understand this configuration

```ts
pluginModuleFederation({
  // ...
  shareStrategy: 'loaded-first',
}),
```

## Reference examples

[Rslib Module Federation Example](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/tree/main/examples/module-federation)

- `mf-host`: Rsbuild App Consumer
- `mf-react-component`: Rslib Module, which is both a producer and a consumer, provides the module to the `mf-host` as a producer, and consumes the `mf-remote`
- `mf-remote`: Rsbuild App Producer
