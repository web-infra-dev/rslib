`plugins` is used to register Rsbuild plugins.

Rslib and Rsbuild share the same plugin system, so you can use Rsbuild plugins in Rslib.

::: note

Currently, some plugins have not been adapted to the [bundleless](/guide/basic/output-structure#bundle--bundleless) mode. For example, the Svelte plugin can only be used in the bundle mode.

## Using plugins

You can register Rsbuild plugins in `rslib.config.*` using the `plugins` option, see [Rsbuild - plugins](https://rsbuild.rs/config/plugins).

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rslib/core';
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
});
```
