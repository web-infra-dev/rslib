A Module Federation remote module built with Rsbuild. It is consumed by [mf-react-component](./mf-react-component/) to show how a Rslib MF module could be consumed by another Rslib app while consuming other remote modules at the same time.

Extra remote module is **optional**, it is used to demonstrate a complex Module Federation set up here.

```bash
pnpm dev
