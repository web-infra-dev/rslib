UMD stands for [Universal Module Definition](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), a pattern for writing JavaScript modules that can work universally across different environments, such as both the browser and Node.js. Its primary goal is to ensure compatibility with the most popular module systems, including AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition), CommonJS (CJS), and browser globals.
