CJS stands for [CommonJS modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules), which is a module system used in JavaScript, particularly in server-side environments like Node.js. It was created to allow JavaScript to be used outside of the browser by providing a way to manage modules and dependencies.
