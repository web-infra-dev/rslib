## Style Processing

### How to skip the preprocessing of Less / Sass files in bundleless mode?

Bundleless means that each source file is compiled and built separately, which can be understood as the process of code conversion of source files only. To skip the preprocessing of `.less/.scss` files, you need to:

1. Set `source.entry` to remove `.less/.scss` files from the entry.
2. Set `output.copy` to copy `.less/.scss` files to the output directory.
3. Set `redirect.style.extension` to `false` to disable the redirect behavior for the import path of `.less/.scss` files.

Below is an example of skipping the `.scss` file processing. All `.scss` files in `src` will be copied to the output directory and retained with consistent relative paths.

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  lib: [
    {
      // ...
      source: {
        entry: {
          index: ['./src/**', '!src/**/*.scss'],
        },
      },
      output: {
        copy: [{ from: '**/*.scss', context: path.join(__dirname, 'src') }],
      },
      redirect: {
        style: {
          extension: false,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Code Minification

### How to preserve all comments in the output files?

By default, Rslib uses SWC to remove comments. The corresponding SWC [jsc.minify.format](https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/minification#jscminifyformat) configuration is

```js
{
    comments: 'some',
    preserveAnnotations: true,
}
```

This will only preserve some legal comments and annotations. If you want to preserve all comments, you can refer to the following configuration

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  lib: [
    // ...
  ],
  output: {
    minify: {
      jsOptions: {
        minimizerOptions: {
          format: {
            comments: 'all', // This will preserve all comments
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### How to compress the output size while preserving code readability?

Compressing code can reduce the output size and improve loading speed, but the compressed code is less readable and harder to debug. If you want to preserve code readability, you can keep variable names and disable compression to facilitate debugging. Refer to [web-infra-dev/rsbuild#966](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/pull/3966).

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  lib: [
    // ...
  ],
  output: {
    minify: {
      jsOptions: {
        minimizerOptions: {
          // preserve variable name and disable minify for easier debugging
          mangle: false,
          minify: false,
          compress: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
