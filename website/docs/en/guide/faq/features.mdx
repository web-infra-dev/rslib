## How to preserve all comments in the output files?

By default, Rslib uses SWC to remove comments. The corresponding SWC [jsc.minify.format](https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/minification#jscminifyformat) configuration is

```js
{
    comments: 'some', //
    preserveAnnotations: true,
}
```

This will only preserve some legal comments and annotations. If you want to preserve all comments, you can refer to the following configuration

```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
export default {
  output: {
    minify: {
      jsOptions: {
        minimizerOptions: {
          format: {
            comments: 'all', // This will preserve all comments
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
