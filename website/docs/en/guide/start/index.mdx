# Introduction

Rslib is a library development tool that leverages the well-designed configurations and plugins of [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev), empowering library developers to take advantage of the extensive knowledge and ecosystem of webpack and Rspack.

Rslib provides a comprehensive set of build features for library development, including:

- **Compilation of diverse languages**: TypeScript, JSX, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, Wasm, and more.
- **Flexible build modes**: Bundle and bundleless options to meet varying needs.
- **Multiple output formats**: ESM, CJS, and UMD for maximum compatibility.
- **Declaration file generation**: Including isolated declarations.
- **Advanced features**: Module Federation, asset compression, PostCSS, Lightning CSS, and more.

## üî• Features

Rslib has the following features:

- **Easy to Configure**: Rslib aims to simplify library development by offering ready-to-use build capabilities, enabling developers to kickstart their library projects with minimal configuration.

- **Performance Oriented**: Rslib integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), [SWC](https://swc.rs/) and [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), to deliver first-class build speed and development experience.

- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Powered by Rsbuild, Rslib benefits from a lightweight plugin system and a collection of high-quality official plugins. Furthermore, Rsbuild's compatibility with most webpack plugins and all Rspack plugins allows library developers to seamlessly integrate existing community or in-house plugins into their library projects.

## üéØ Ecosystem

Rslib is implemented based on Rsbuild and fully reuses the capabilities and ecology of Rsbuild.
