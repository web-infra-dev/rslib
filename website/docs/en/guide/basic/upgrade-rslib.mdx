# Upgrade Rslib

This section explains how to upgrade the project's Rslib dependencies to the latest version.

{/* TODO */}
{/* > Please see [Releases](/community/releases/index) to understand the Rsbuild release strategy. */}

:::info

Rslib is still in 0.x version stage, and the API may change frequently. We recommend upgrading to the latest version to access new features and bug fixes.

:::

## Using Taze

We recommend using [Taze](https://github.com/antfu-collective/taze) to upgrade the Rslib version. Taze is a CLI tool for updating npm dependencies.

### Usage

Run the following command to upgrade all dependencies that include `rslib` and `rsbuild` in their names:

```bash
npx taze major --include "/(rsbuild|rslib)/" -w
```

:::tip
Rslib has not yet reached version 1.0.0, so you need to add the `major` parameter when updating.
:::

The result will look similar to:

```bash
rslib - 2 major, 1 patch

  @rsbuild/plugin-react       dev  ~2mo  ^1.0.1   →  ^1.0.6
  @rslib/core                 dev  ~7d  ^0.0.15  →  ^0.0.16
  rsbuild-plugin-dts          dev  ~7d  ^0.0.15  →  ^0.0.16

ℹ changes written to package.json, run npm i to install updates.
```

You can also adjust the `include` pattern to match specific packages, for example, to upgrade only packages under the `@rslib` scope:

```bash
npx taze --include /@rslib/ -w
```

### Options

Here are some examples of using taze options.

- In a monorepo, you can add the `-r` option to upgrade recursively:

```bash
npx taze --include /(rsbuild|rslib)/ -w -r
```

- Add `-l` to upgrade locked versions:

```bash
npx taze --include /(rsbuild|rslib)/ -w -l
```

- To upgrade to a major version:

```bash
npx taze major --include /(rsbuild|rslib)/ -w
```
