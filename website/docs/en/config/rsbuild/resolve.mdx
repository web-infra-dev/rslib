## resolve.aliasStrategy <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias-strategy" text="resolve.aliasStrategy" />

`resolve.aliasStrategy` is used to control the priority between the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json` and the `alias` option in the bundler.

## resolve.alias <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias" text="resolve.alias" />

Create aliases to import or require certain modules, same as the [resolve.alias](https://rspack.dev/config/resolve#resolvealias) config of Rspack.

It is important to note that `resolve.alias` differs from [output.externals](/config/rsbuild/output#outputexternals) in the following ways:

- `resolve.alias` allows you to replace the target module you want to include in the output bundles with another module. It only works if [lib.bundle](/config/lib/bundle) is set to `true`.

  For example, if you want to replace `lodash` with `lodash-es` in a bundled CLI application, you can configure it as follows:

  ```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
  export default {
    // ...
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        lodash: 'lodash-es',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  All `lodash` modules imported in the source code will be mapped to `lodash-es` and be bundled into the output.

- `output.externals` is used to handle alias mapping for externalized modules. Externalized modules are not included in the bundle; instead, they are imported from external sources at runtime.

  For example, if you want to replace `react` and `react-dom` with `preact/compat` in the bundle, you can configure it as follows:

  ```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
  export default {
    // ...
    output: {
      externals: {
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Now, the code `import { useState } from 'react'` will be replaced with `import { useState } from 'preact/compat'`.

## resolve.dedupe <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/dedupe" text="resolve.dedupe" />

`resolve.dedupe` is used to resolve the specified packages from project root, which is useful for deduplicating packages and reducing the bundle size.
