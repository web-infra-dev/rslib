Rslib is a library development tool that leverages the well-designed configurations and plugins of [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev), empowering library developers to take advantage of the extensive knowledge and ecosystem of webpack and Rspack.

Rslib aims to provide library developers with:

- **Easy Library Creation**: Easily create high-quality JavaScript and TypeScript libraries in a simple and intuitive way.
- **Simple Build Configuration**: Provides out-of-the-box build capabilities to meet the diverse needs of library development scenarios with simple configurations.
- **Comprehensive Development Workflow**: Contains best practices for building, debugging, documentation, and testing during library development to help improve development efficiency and experience.

## üî• Features

Rslib has the following features:

- **Compilation of diverse languages**: TypeScript, JSX, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, Wasm, and more.
- **Flexible build modes**: Bundle and bundleless options to meet varying needs.
- **Multiple output formats**: ESM, CJS, and UMD for maximum compatibility.
- **Declaration file generation**: Including isolated declarations.
- **Advanced features**: Module Federation, asset compression, PostCSS, Lightning CSS, and more.

## üéØ Ecosystem

Rslib is implemented based on Rsbuild and fully reuses the capabilities and ecosystem of Rsbuild.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between Rslib and other tools in the ecosystem:
