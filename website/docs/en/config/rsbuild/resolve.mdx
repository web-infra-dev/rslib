# resolve

Options for module resolution.

## resolve.aliasStrategy <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias-strategy" text="resolve.aliasStrategy" />

Control the priority between the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json` and the `resolve.alias` option of Rsbuild.

## resolve.alias <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias" text="resolve.alias" />

Create aliases to import or require certain modules, same as the [resolve.alias](https://rspack.dev/config/resolve#resolvealias) config of Rspack.

It is worth noting that in bundle mode, both `resolve.alias` and [output.externals](/config/rsbuild/output#outputexternals) can be used to set aliases, but they differ in the following ways:

- `resolve.alias` is used to replace the target module with another module, which will be bundled into the output.

  For example, if you want to replace `lodash` with `lodash-es` when bundling a package, you can configure it as follows:

  ```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
  export default {
    // ...
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        lodash: 'lodash-es',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Now, all `lodash` imports in the source code will be mapped to `lodash-es` and bundled into the output.

- `output.externals` is used to handle alias mapping for externalized modules. Externalized modules are not included in the bundle; instead, they are imported from external sources at runtime.

  For example, if you want to replace externalized modules `react` and `react-dom` with `preact/compat` in the bundle, you can configure it as follows:

  ```ts title="rslib.config.ts"
  export default {
    // ...
    output: {
      externals: {
        react: 'preact/compat',
        'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Now, the code `import { useState } from 'react'` will be replaced with `import { useState } from 'preact/compat'`.

::: note
In bundleless mode, since there is no bundling concept, all modules will be externalized, so Rslib will automatically externalize the aliased module in the final output by using `output.externals`.
:::

## resolve.dedupe <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/dedupe" text="resolve.dedupe" />

Force Rsbuild to resolve the specified packages from project root, which is useful for deduplicating packages and reducing the bundle size.

## resolve.extensions <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/extensions" text="resolve.extensions" />

Automatically resolve file extensions when importing modules. This means you can import files without explicitly writing their extensions.
