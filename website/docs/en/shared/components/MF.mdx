Module Federation is an architectural pattern for JavaScript application decomposition (similar to microservices on the server-side), allowing you to share code and resources between multiple JavaScript applications (or micro-frontends).

See [Module Federation](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/advanced/module-federation) for more details.
