Rslib is a Rsbuild-based library build tool that offers tree-shaking friendly ESM output, minimizes additional runtime code, and supports CommonJS and dts output.

When you use Rslib to build a library, you can reuse any webpack loader, as well as webpack plugins, Rspack plugins, and Rsbuild plugins.

This means that the build infrastructure for building web applications and libraries is consistent, and the ecosystem can be reused.

> Rslib is still in its early stages and under active development. It will be available in October 2024.
> You can check some available [examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/tree/main/examples) in the repository.
