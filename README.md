Rslib is a library build tool powered by [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev). It allows package developers to leverage Rspack knowledge and its ecosystem. Rslib is built on top of Rsbuild's excellent configurations and plugins, ensuring optimal ESM output quality.

Rslib provides out-of-the-box configurations for library development, including compilation of TypeScript, JSX, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, and Wasm, supporting Module Federation, image compression, type checking, PostCSS, and Lightning CSS.

> !NOTE
> 🚧 Rslib is still in its early stages and under active development. It will be available in October 2024.
> You can check some available [examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/tree/main/examples) in the repository.

## ✨ Why Rslib?

In the past, we typically did not use webpack or Rspack to build ESM packages because they often included excessive runtime code, making them less friendly to package consumers. However, we have developed a vast ecosystem around webpack and Rspack, which provides powerful features like tree shaking, code splitting, and module federation. So we decided to create Rslib. This tool improves the quality of ESM output from Rspack and webpack, leverages their extensive ecosystem, and utilizes Rsbuild's excellent out-of-the-box configuration. Rslib aims to provide a superior developer experience and explore new possibilities based on the Rspack architecture.

## 📍 Roadmap

We have roadmap for [features track](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/issues/46) and [bundler support track](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/issues/45). You can view the project's progress there. The roadmap may change as we move forward.
