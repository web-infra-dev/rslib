# Quick start

## Setup environment

Before getting started, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.12.0, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

## Creating an Rslib project

You can use the [`create-rslib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rslib) to create a new Rslib project. Run the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npm create rslib@latest',
    yarn: 'yarn create rslib',
    pnpm: 'pnpm create rslib@latest',
    bun: 'bun create rslib@latest',
  }}
/>

Then follow the prompts to complete the operation.

### Templates

`create-rslib` is a tool for quickly creating Rslib projects. When creating a project, you can choose from the following templates:

| Template                     | Description                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Node.js dual ESM/CJS package | Node.js dual ESM/CJS package |
| Node.js pure ESM package     | Node.js pure ESM package     |
| React                        | React component library      |
| Vue                          | Vue component library        |

Each template supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, along with optional development tools, formatters, and linters.

### Development tools

`create-rslib` can help you set up some commonly used development tools, including [Rstest](https://rstest.rs/)、[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). You can use the arrow keys and the space bar to make your selections. If you don't need these tools, you can simply press Enter to skip.

- Rstest and Vitest are available for all templates, it will be adapted based on the template's selection.
- Storybook is available for web targeted templates (React, Vue), it will be adapted based on the template's selection.

```text
◆  Select development tools (Use <space> to select, <enter> to continue)
│  ◻ Storybook
│  ◻ Rstest
│  ◻ Vitest
└
```

### Optional tools

`create-rslib` can help you set up some commonly used linter and formatter tools, including [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can use the arrow keys and the space bar to make your selections. If you don't need these tools, you can simply press Enter to skip.

```text
◆  Select additional tools (Use <space> to select, <enter> to continue)
│  ◻ Add Biome for code linting and formatting
│  ◻ Add ESLint for code linting
│  ◻ Add Prettier for code formatting
└
```

:::tip
Biome provides similar linting and formatting features to ESLint and Prettier. If you select Biome, you typically won't need to choose ESLint or Prettier as well.

### Current directory

If you need to create a project in the current directory, you can set the target folder to `.`:

```text
◆  Create Rslib Project
│
◇  Project name or path
│  .
│
◇  "." is not empty, please choose:
│  Continue and override files
```

### Quick creation

[create-rslib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-rslib) provides some CLI flags. By setting these CLI flags, you can skip the interactive selection steps and create the project with one command.

For example, to create an example project in the `my-project` directory with one command:

```bash
npx create-rslib --dir my-project --template example

# Using abbreviations
npx create-rslib -d my-project -t example
```

All the CLI flags of `create-rslib`:

```text

  -t, --template   specify the template to use
  --tools          select additional tools (biome, eslint, prettier)

```

## Migrate from existing projects

- [Migrating from tsup](/guide/migration/tsup)
- [Migrating from Modern.js Module](/guide/migration/modernjs-module)

### Other projects

For other types of projects, you can manually install the [@rslib/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rslib/core) package:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rslib/core -D" />

Then refer to the guide and documentation to enable the features you need:

- See [CLI](/guide/basic/cli) to learn about available CLI commands.
- See [Configure Rslib](/guide/basic/configure-rslib) to configure Rslib.
