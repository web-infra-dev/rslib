# Modern.js Module tests coverage

Rslib will try to cover the common scenarios in the [integration test cases of Modern.js Module](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js/tree/main/tests/integration/module). This document is used to record the coverage situation. The supported types are divided into three types: "fully supported", "Partial supported", "not supported, but planned to support" and "not supported, not planned to support".
