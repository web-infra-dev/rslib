Rslib is a library development tool that leverages the well-designed configurations and plugins of [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev), empowering library developers to take advantage of the extensive knowledge and ecosystem of webpack and Rspack.

## ‚ú® Why Rslib?

In the past, we typically did not use webpack or Rspack to build ESM packages because they often included excessive runtime code, making them less friendly to package consumers. However, the community has developed a vast ecosystem around webpack and Rspack, which provides powerful features like tree shaking, code splitting, module federation and more.

So we decided to create Rslib. It improves the quality of ESM output from Rspack and webpack, leverages their extensive ecosystem, and utilizes Rsbuild's excellent out-of-the-box configuration. Rslib aims to provide a superior developer experience and explore new possibilities based on the Rspack architecture.

Rslib is still in its early stages and under active development. We are building Rslib by working in two main parts:

- [bundler support track](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/issues/45): Improve the quality of ESM / CJS outputs by contributing to Rspack and webpack.
- [Rslib features track](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib/issues/46): Develop the core features of Rslib.

The roadmap may change as we move forward.

## üî• Features

Rslib has the following features:

- **Compilation of diverse languages**: TypeScript, JSX, Sass, Less, CSS Modules, Wasm, and more.
- **Flexible build modes**: Bundle and bundleless options to meet varying needs.
- **Multiple output formats**: ESM, CJS, and UMD for maximum compatibility.
- **Declaration file generation**: Including isolated declarations.
- **Advanced features**: Module Federation, asset compression, PostCSS, Lightning CSS, and more.
